# About

Bionic is an [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) CLI clone for [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) projects.

The goal is to provide a easy, modular and repeatable way of creating, building and deploying Blazor projects.

Keep in mind that just like Blazor, this is an **exploration** project. With your help we can make it a reality.

## Features

- SCSS Style Isolation: Pages and component have their own scss file for quick and easy styling.
- Hot Rebuild: Automatically rebuild modified source or scss code (hot reloading not available yet).
- Component Generation: Quickly generate Blazor pages, components and services.
- Modular Platform Architecture: Project deployment platforms are provided through plugins and isolated within each project.
- Blast Scripting: Execute a group of commands under a single target name.

## Why

With the introduction of [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/why-webassembly-is-a-game-changer-for-the-web-and-a-source-of-pride-for-mozilla-and-firefox-dda80e4c43cb) in the browser, it is now possible to use other languages other than JavaScript to build amazing web apps that run a near native speed. What this means is that other languages can now share code between frontend and backend without having to compromise computation power and typesafety as so often happens in the world of JavaScript.

WebAssembly is maturing and will soon provide more functionality such as Garbage Collection, Multi-Threading and much more.

When [Steve Sanderson](https://github.com/SteveSanderson) created Blazor, the whole promise of having WebAssembly on the frontend for web applications just became reachable.

At this point, marrying the power of Blazor with the power of a CLI, just made sense.

Hope you all have fun Blazing through some cool apps!
